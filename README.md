# Gravity Forms Zendesk Add-On

Gravity Forms Zendesk Add-On integrates Gravity Forms with Zendesk allowing form submissions to be automatically sent as a new ticket to your Zendesk account.  It utilizes the [Zendesk v2 API](https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/core/introduction), [GFFeedAddOn](http://www.gravityhelp.com/documentation/gravity-forms/extending-gravity-forms/add-on-framework/gffeedaddon/), PHP, and cURL.

## Please Note:  This is NOT production ready.  While it technically works, it is a shell of a project I want to create when I have time from another exisiting project ([gravity-forms-to-zendesk-ticket](https://github.com/christirichards/gravity-forms-to-zendesk-ticket)) to integrate tighter with Gravity Forms.

### Version

0.1-alpha

### Requirements

You need a working Wordpress installation, Gravity Forms plugin installed and at least one form to reference, Zendesk API key/credentials, and cURL enabled on your server.
